note.innerHTML += `<p>This week was geared towards organizing the course information, 
meeting my classmates, and locating and reading the study material.<br>

<br>By reading the book "Doing Stuff with Web Things" a new view of learning javascript. 
Until now my learning had been knowing, interpreting code, and modifying it to adapt it to my needs. 
But this new vision projects me toward new learning as the author puts it 
"(...) This book begins with line-by-line explanations but gradually allows you, 
the reader, to learn more deeply by taking more responsibility for remembering things that 
you have already learned and applying them in new situations (...)".<br>

<br>The most relevant for me in the review of the Syllabus were the prerequisites, 
because I several of the topics I mastered a bit, but there are others, such as fetch, 
map, and filter that require more attention.<br>

<br>Regarding the use of VScode, GitHub, Teams, Node, and Slack, they are widely known to me. 
I haven't used Trello so I'm looking forward to it.<br>

<br>So far it has been a good experience working in a group at BYUI. At the beginning of each course,
 it is a bit difficult to belong to a group, because there is uncertainty about who our partners 
 will be, but once the group is formed it is very easy to communicate.<br>

<br>Finally, the most complicated thing I see this week is what concerns Managing the Modern 
Frontend Workflow. This topic was unknown to me and I did not understand much of what I read.<br>`
