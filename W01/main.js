note.innerHTML += `<p>This week was geared towards organizing the course information, 
meeting my classmates, and locating and reading the study material.<br>

<br>By reading the book "Doing Stuff with Web Things" a new view of learning javascript. 
Until now my learning had been knowing, interpreting code, and modifying it to adapt it to my needs. 
But this new vision projects me toward new learning as the author puts it 
"(...) This book begins with line-by-line explanations but gradually allows you, 
the reader, to learn more deeply by taking more responsibility for remembering things that 
you have already learned and applying them in new situations (...)".<br>

<br>As for the recommended chapter for this week, I learned what I wanted to have 
and that is the ability for javascript to store in the 'localStorage' variable. 
I couldn't complete all the code but I thought it was great to have this javascript attribute.<br>

<br>In relation to the "Master Mobile UX" video, it was a great experience to learn how 
currently web development must be more oriented to satisfy the needs of new hardware technology. 
This takes into account that the desktop computer has been shrinking and the use of tablets 
and mobile phones has increased.</p>`
