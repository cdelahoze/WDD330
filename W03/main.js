note.innerHTML += `<p> In order to design a usable and pleasant mobile experience, 
apart from a good first-time users completing basic tasks, the speed with which they 
can execute them is required, so they must be intuitive in such a way that the learning 
capacity is high. In the same way, it is required that the user can easily remember the 
use of the system and it is easy to correct errors. Finally, 
the experience when using the design is pleasant.<br>

<br>Notifications for new content should appear without interrupting the main content. 
The size of the target and the spacing between targets must be scaled correctly so that 
the user does not make mistakes when performing actions. The user must have control over 
her actions. Additionally, the content must be readable. (30 to 40 characters per line 
is a good rule of thumb.) Interface elements must be clearly visible. Hand position controls 
are also important so equipment design is crucial. Data entry should be minimized. 
Finally, it is best to test your design.
