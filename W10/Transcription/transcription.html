this video, we are going to. Lay out the foundations of how. We're going to see
the execution context comprising memory and the threat of execution. We're
going to see how those execution contexts are tracked by JavaScript. With the
pool stack and we're going to do all of this to understand the foundations of
the language that are. Going to let. The hard parts that follow much more
naturally. This is a place to begin. Welcome to the video series. I'm glad to
have you along. Alright, so here we go. Starting off to get ourselves. We're
going to get the hard parts in a serious way. But to get ourselves there, we
have to build out the foundations of fundamentals. The principles of
JavaScript. This is how when we take a block of code, what we do when we run
code. I remember the first time I saw running. Code. So what? Is it doing? It's
taking words that have meaning in some application. In this case this
application is the JavaScript engine that interprets those words. And uses as
and instructions. Uses them as instructions to tell our computer, in this case,
particularly our web browser, what to do. Well, how does that process work? Well,
let's see. But no, these foundations are going to feel very, very pedantic,
almost very overly specific. But they're going to. Allow us to understand all
the hard parts to come. So here we go. What happens when jobs would execute, in
other words, runs takes my code and starts doing it. What happens?</span></a></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="background:#D9E2F3;mso-background-themecolor:accent1;

What's this word mean? What's this word mean? It's doing it line by line,
correct? And what are all the time? Is it telling? Our browse one time is it
actually? Doing when it's taking a. Line what's it's doing, Skyler.</span></a></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="background:#FBE4D5;mso-background-themecolor:accent2;

stuff in memory exactly 2 main things we do, and we run our code, we store
stuff in memory and in order to encounter that stuff to be sort of memory,
we're going to go through our code line by line, take it, and run it, execute
it, and that taking the code. That is known as a threat of execution that. Is
itâ€™s a? Thread weaving its way through and. Executing the code line by line.
And as I say. All the time it's hitting code that's saying save. Stuff to memory.
So, we're going to map that out ourselves on. The whiteboard. Here we go. Line
1 we're going to map it out. We're going to see exactly what it does and we're
going to represent the thread of execution. That means going through the code
line by line on this side here, and then we're going to store any of the
variables or functions we declare on the right-hand side here. It's going to be
our memory. And memory we're going to. Represent these all the whiteboard so we
can. Really follow us exactly how ours. Code is executed and. There's nothing
if we have that. There's nothing we can't interpreted then we can't understand
if we are going through the. Way that our jobs should engine actually. Executes
our code. There's something we can't understand. Right to line 1, Lewis. You
have the honor. What are we? Doing our very first line of code, Lewis.</span></a></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="background:#FBE4D5;mso-background-themecolor:accent2;

on the. Left hand side there's our label. When I declare a function, it's
tempting to think it's a sort of JavaScript. Just sees that line and goes Hoh

It's going to grab that. Label and it's going to. Use that as a label for all
the functionalities. The whole function definition, the whole set of
instructions from the keyword function right, and it's going to capture that
and store it on the label. Multiply by two. Alright, next line, Skyler.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">So, we're going to declare a

3, grabs one by two is the following grabs. Name is, Will and. It never goes
inside one by two unless we. Call multiplied by two. If we don't call it by
two, we never go inside it, alright? So we go name is declared and stalled. Is
will alright so. What is this thing we've done here? As soon as we start
running our code, we create what is known as an execution context, a word we
may hear many times. It is the most profound. Thing we do in jobs, what is it?
Doing we've seen it. We've seen both things it. Does it's the. Process of going
for power of going through our. Code line by. Line and doing whatever it says
to do and the memory in which we store any variables or functions that get
declared announced. Those two things together are known as an execution context
A. Context means like a space, A space in which to execute our code, and in
order to execute that. Code we need. The thread of execution that goes through.
The code and takes it line by line and then a memory in which. To store that
stuff. And those two together and as a context in which we execute our code, a
space in which we edit. The and execution context. And we start, we start off
as soon as we start writing code with a global one. That means it's going to
take, we're going to see in a minute what's called a function level execution
context. When we start running a function, we think we have our thread weaves
inside and starts running the code inside that function line by line, and we
create another memory just for the stuff inside that function, but for. Now
we're in the. Global execution context. That means it's the stuff that we.
Declare in memory when. We first start running our application. Is going to be
available. Anywhere inside of our application. So we're gonna call this the
global memory and this is our global execution context. And you can almost think
of it like running like the whole application is a big function which we can
sort of think of as being global, and we're running the whole application. So
we went through it line by line. We didn't write it out. We just store this off
in memory. But think of us going. Through and hitting the code line. By line in
our thread. As soon as our code we create. A global execution context.
Comprising a thread of execution going through our code line by line and a live
memory of a stuff actually stored. Some people think when we call a function,
we go back up the page to the function are when we encounter that function, we
grabbed it and we stored it in memory. It's that place that we go and. Look for
anything. That we then then later. On refer to. Posh name for the global memory
is the. Global variable environment environment means that things around me so
it's. A variables that are available around me in my code. The global variable
environment alright above it. So the thread as I. Say this posh thing that the
posh name for going through the code. And by line. We go through it in order
from top to bottom of our page. I never skip a line. And I never suddenly
grabbed this line down here and go back. Up to the we. Go in order line by
line. That means it is synchronous. In order of encountering top to bottom.
Down the page that is the. Order we follow and single threaded. One thing at a
time. I am not starting to execute a function. And continuing to do that while
simultaneously continuing down the rest of my. Code at the. Same time or if I
say using a function, my thread is not continuing down the code down. The rest
of the page I'm going to go inside of that function and start executing the
code inside of. It it is. Single threaded, one line at a time, one thing at a time
in order. Now we talk about the most important piece. Of or most important tool
in. Our JavaScript kit, which is the function functions. Our way of. Wrapping
up some instructions, some code to be done later on. And we give them a label.
For now, we give them the code. We've written a label for now, which saves us
having to write all that. Code out every. Time we want to. Run it so we just
wrap it up, give it a label, and then we refer to it later on and say go run
that functionality. OK, let's see that so. We have declared numbers 3 multiply
by two as a. Function what is? Our next line of code to declare or to run
Philip.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">We declare A variable named output.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">Output excellent in we set it equal
to the evaluated result of multiplied by two.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">So we declare. Output but we. We
don't yet know what's gonna be stored in output, so you called it the evaluated
result. You're basically saying this right hand side. In the cooling and
multiply by two is. Going to go and do some work. And it's gonna get a result.
That means it's gonna evaluate 2 results. We'll get some sort of output and
that is then what's gonna be stored in output. Perfect. All right, very nice.
By the way, how do I know that? How do I know that I haven't yet finished my
work on the right hand side here? Tell me that on the right hand side here
there's work to be done. The parentheses, the parentheses, they say. Go look
for that function. Code multiply by two. Yeah, you know, look. Go look for
multiply by two. We'll be passing in Philip.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">The number four, but the parameter
is.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">Well, the number 4. And this the
return output. The return value of this function call is going. To be stored in
output perfect. Now we know that this right hand side has not finished doing
its work yet, because we can't still multiply by two parents 4IN output or
store here. We gonna go and do the work. Of running this function, whatever
gets. Returned out whatever. The output is. We're going to store in in output.
When we call a function. It's going to do a bunch of work inside of it, and
whatever gets returned out, it's going to almost fully replace this function
invocation. This function calling and then. That's when you saw an output. So
for now we don't let know what to put. An output but. JavaScript never leaves
anything. There's never a label. Without a value. There's always some value on
the right hand side. Never moves on without putting some value. What value does
it default to? You know undefined, not null some phone. My thing is not, it
defaults to undefined. We don't yet know what to store an output yet, so just
leave it undefined and now go and start running the code. Inside this function,
and by the way. Anything we saw, anything we? Declare inside this function,
putting a little memory just for that function, not global memory. But a little
memory. Just for that function. It sounds a lot like. We've got to spin up an
execution context just like we did for our overall code. Now for the function
code, the code inside that function multiplied by two. We're going to do. What
is called? A function level or. That's called local local because. Who knows
local? Not big like global local execution context.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">There it is.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">And just like. We had for our overall
execution of our. Code a global memory where everything was. Stored and we were
going through the. Code line by line. We hit, we hit. Continuum equals three.
We hit multiply by. Two, as the click and then we hit output. Well, we don't
get to. Continue with our thread for now. Our thread is gonna weave its way in
and start running the. Code inside multiply. By two now that weaving the thread
and that local memory together are known as an execution context, a space in
which to run our code of multiply by two so. What is the first? Thing that
we're going to do. Inside that module by two functions, Skyler.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">You're going to declare a variable

is our what Lewis. That's your. That's to say that when I define multiply by
two, I said you want to be able. To use me multiple times. And you want to use
my multiply my by by two functionality multiple times, but you don't yet know
what number you want to multiply by two, so leave a placeholder input number
and then when you run me when you execute me when you invoke me. They're the
same thing when you do that with parens. Only way to. Well, we're gonna see
today to run. Make sure you fill that input number placeholder parameter blank
in with an actual value, which is what Lewis which is our.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">Our our argument.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">And you're in.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">When we call the function. We have an
argument that's our actual value that we. Stick in when we run the function
perfect. Scarlet will get assigned a result. We declare a result we. Assigned
to it. You know the result.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">Of running two.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">Perfect, which is 8. Skylar, keep me
going.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">So then you're.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">Going to return.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">That result very well.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">Let's say the value of result. So
when JavaScript sees return result it goes what is result ohh. It's eight and
returns that value. Out into what, Skyler? Into the global ohh into what global
variable? Perfect return 8 into output and our thread now weaves its way back.
Out to global? And how do? We know to exit multiplied by two. What keyword
tells it exit? For the return return, this is what? Ends the running multiple
by two function returns us back out to the global execution context our thread
was was going through and now it's back out where it encounters what life.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">Declaring a new variable called new.

the quarter multiply by two. The input of 1010 and that would spin up another
execution context. We're not gonna go into it. For now new output will default
to undefined until it gets the return value until it gets the return value.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">Of of our.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">Call to multiply by two. What we can see?
Here, though, whatever that would return would return it out into new output.
What we can see here, though, is that there's. There's a a layer of complexity
in these execution contexts, contexts, contexts, and execution contexts. So
many hard consonants in decision contexts. There's a level of complexity here.
There is that we can visually see the sky. Who said I've finished running?
Multiply by two. I return eight out into the global execution context and. The
global variable output. Now, Sky didn't see that because you can see you
multiply by two. Is to the right hand side of the output constant. He he can
visually see when I finish inside multiplied by two execution context returned
to the execution context in which I was previously. But JavaScript doesn't have
that sort of visual sense of of how these boxes are working. Well, it has to
track which execution context I'm in at any one time. Am I inside will provide
2 the call to the GOLDFIRE 2 function am inside. The calls this. This next call
to mode two function. And it's either. Global sort of. Call the the global
execution context. If I were to run another function inside. Of mode one. Or
two where? Where would that be? You have to keep track of where it is and where
to go back to when it finishes where it is. So if I'm inside the Cordoba 2.
Multiplied by two when I'm finished because I. Called model 2IN global, I want
to be able to. Know to go back to global and JavaScript has a special sort of
data store to track that journey where it is, where it was and therefore. It's
going to go back to. And that structure? Anyone know what's known as see just
stack call stack a stack of calls to functions when when we call a function we
create an execution context. So it's a stack of a call so. Functions, we call
it call. Here is a cool stack of it. And it is. A great way of representing it.
It's a great way of representing our functions being called inside of each
other. I start off in global. So stack is something from our world. Of
programming from computer science, and it's just like an array. An array says I
want to store data at a list where I care about the order of the data, and I
also want to go grab a piece of data at position 7. And position 2. A stack is
perfect for tracking our execution context because stacks I only care about
adding something on top of it, like a stack of plates adding on top of it. I
can't take a random plate out. I only care about anything on top of it, and
then when removing that plate, the next plate down is still there. It's all I.
Same thing here. I only care about. Adding something multiplied by two inside
of global and then when I finish 20 multiply 2 need to go back out more by two.
Go back out to global. It's a really great way of representing our calls to
functions and the first, the first one we. Add therefore to our. Of calls is a
global execution context and we never leave that one as long as our application
is running, it's always. There on the. Bottom when I. Start executing multiply
by two. I add it on top multiply. By two in vote with four. That is for when I
am inside. So while I was inside of this multiplied by two function so it was
on top of. My call stack. And when I step out of it, what do we think happens
when? I multiply 2 phones on the call.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">It looks off.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">Ah, I remove the call and the posh
name. For removing from the call stack is. To pop it off. To pop the call to,
multiply by two off the positive. Adding it is to push, push it on, pop it off
alright and if I were to run more by. Two again with 10. That would be added on
the call stack.</span></a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"> <span lang="EN-US" style="color: windowtext;">Again, and if.</span></a><span lang="EN-US"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <span style="color: windowtext;">I then call another function inside
of. Here that would be then. One layer above. To my call stack. Alright, so my
call stack is my final piece of the core fundamentals of how our JavaScript
code executes. When you execute a function, you create a new execution context
which all that is all execution context is nothing. Has a profound but. All it
is is our thread of execution, meaning we take the code and multiply by two and
we start going through it line by line by line, storing stuff in memory as we.
As I say, a local memory, by the way, sometimes known as a variable environment
in which everything inside that function anything gets defined, is stored
inside that function's local memory. All right, and that execution context, we
keep track of those. With our whole stack. Our call to the function is tracked.
Our call to the function is tracked on our. Stack of calls. And this people. Is
all of. Are fundamental building blocks of JavaScript execution. This is it,
we. See it all. OK. As I say, we keep track of our calls in the call. Stack
folks, we now have the underlying principles. We can see straight away, I know
that calling multiply by two with the number four returns to output 8. It needs
to do it for. One second, but. When I have these. Foundational pieces built out
with clarity and completeness. All the hard parts follow more naturally. So
this was. Our hard parts preamble. Now we move on to hard part part one for
