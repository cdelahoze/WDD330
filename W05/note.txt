<h2>Fetch</h2>

<p>The fetch() method is modern and versatile</p>

<p>In order to strengthen the learning of this method, in the current notes 
page I used fetch in two ways:</p>

<lu>
<li>Create a text file which I call with fetch in a script that in turn manipulates the HTML.</li>
<li>Create a JSON file with an array containing the note list information for each week.</li>
</lu>

<h2>Fetch: Cross-Origin Requests"</h2>


<p>CORS exists to protect the internet from evil hackers. Cross-origin requests, those sent 
to another domain (even a subdomain) or protocol or port, require special headers from the 
remote side. Consequently, the parties agree to share the information. The most common way 
to share information is through the JSON protocol. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a 
lightweight data interchange format. JSON is easy for users to read and write. 
JSON is easy for machines to parse and generate.<br>
<br>Las solicitudes "seguras" deben cumplir las siguientes condiciones:</p>

<ul>
<li>Método: GET, POST o HEAD.</li>
<li>Encabezados: solo podemos establecer:</li>
<ul>
<li>Accept</li>
<li>Accept-Language</li>
<li>Content-Language</li>
<li>Content-Type al valor , o .application/x-www-form-urlencodedmultipart/form-datatext/plain</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Rest parameters and spread syntax</h2>

<p>

JavaScript uses three periods (...) for both the rest and spread operators. 
But these two operators are not the same.
<br><br>
The main difference between rest and the spread operator is that the rest operator 
puts the remainder of some specific user-supplied values into a JavaScript array. 
But programming expands iterables into individual elements.

<h2>How Single-Page Applications Work</h2>

<p>

A single page application (SPA), also sometimes known as a single page interface (SPI), is a web 
application or website that "snaps" onto an individual page and updates the page dynamically, 
rather than loading a new page. The main advantage of SPAs is that they provide a more reactive 
and fluid user experience. The SPA concept has been around for over 15 years, but only in the 
last few years has it gained traction. Advances in technology and frameworks have made SPAs a 
real possibility for developers and organizations.
<br><br>
A single-page application (SPA) is a website that re-renders its content in response to 
navigation actions (e.g. clicking a link) without making a request to the server to 
fetch new HTML.
<br><br>
Single-page applications control navigation so that we re-use the active instead of sending a request to a server
<br><br>
Routers are typically used to power route matching within a single-page application. 
Route matching is done when the location changes, determines which route matches the 
new location, and then triggers a re-render of the application.
<br><br>
In-app navigation is performed using the History API. The default click behavior for anchors 
is overridden to use and to navigate. A event listener is used to detect navigation with 
the browser’s forward/back buttons. The click handler and event listener should both inform 
the router about the navigation to trigger the route matching cycle

<h2>The Problem with Single Page Apps</h2>

<p>
SPAs find problems with SEO.
<br><br>
SPAs load content on the page asynchronously, which means that the data is updated in the application 
without refreshing the page. SEO crawlers don't like this because it depends on JavaScript. 
With a SPA, once the page loads, the crawler's job is complete. The tracking agent does not 
know that the data changes as a user navigates through the page and that data is eventually 
rendered on the page.
<br><br>
SPAs cannot be run without JavaScript.
Most pages have JavaScript turned on so it's not a problem, but if JavaScript is 
turned off the page won't work.
<br><br>
SPAs tend to favor modern browsers.
This can be a limitation if you are trying to use as many browser versions as possible 
for your application. You may be in a position where you are not compatible.
<br><br> 
AMPs would be the best option here, and consequently have more existing frameworks 
and best practices to draw from. As a new developer this makes it much easier to work 
with MPA it's still important to monitor your API when developing MPA or SPA.
