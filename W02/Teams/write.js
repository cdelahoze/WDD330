since the last meeting?</b></p>

<p>This was our first
meeting, so prior to this meeting I was preparing the content of the teamwork assignment
and getting to know my teammates.</p>

<p><b>What am I going to do
next?</span></b></p>

<p>For this week it is
necessary to master more Node. So, I have started
to watch some tutorials to strengthen my knowledge.</p>

<p><b>What are my blockers?</b></p>

<p>There is a lot of new
knowledge, which takes me more time than expected. The important thing is that
I understand it, however, I must demand more of myself than planned.</p>`
