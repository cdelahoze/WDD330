const note = document.getElementById('note')


note.innerHTML += `<p>This week's readings strengthened my knowledge of JavaScript in a more 
complex dimension.<br>

<br><b>Modification of the document</b>. This concept was very easy to learn because I already 
knew some of what you can do from JavaScript to modify HTML. However, the knowledge was new. 
As notes, I decided rather to experiment with the codes to better appreciate the effect obtained. 
In this link, you can see the exercises. For me, it is more practical to have them like this 
for greater ease when you need them.</p>

<p><b>Local storage.</b> This topic was very difficult for me to understand at first. 
In particular, I did not find the use of it. For this reason, I went to some tutorials 
that showed me in a more practical way. Local storage in JavaScript is 
very necessary to store information on the page without the need to use cookies 
or a server. In the same way, I captured my notes in some practical exercises that 
I saved to use them later when I need them. In this link, it is possible to appreciate them.</p>

<p><br><b>Modules: Import and Export.</b> I find it quite useful to be able to export and import information
 to and from JavaScript files. However, for the moment I did not find a practical utility. 
 You may need to seek more information about it.<br>
